== Description ==

Basic Rating Post Plugin post and page plugin.
A Rating Post plugin provides additional access to the admin for determining extensive quantitative data. It narrows down the process of calculating user experience.
Simple but flexible, as it has a rating scale of 1 to 5 which makes it even more easier for a user to express their experience for a dedicated post and a page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `Rating Post Plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
